INTRODUCTION                                    *f11*

F11 will remember your window size and position and hide the tabline when in gvim fullscreen mode. This utility plugin depends on the gvimfullscrenn.dll from here (https://github.com/derekmcloughlin/gvimfullscreen_win32/tree/master). On linux this plugin tries to call wmctrl (install via package manager) for fullscreen gvim mode.

CONFIG                                        *f11-config* *f11-options* *f11-settings*

By default f11 will be toggled by pressing <F11>. You can customize this by putting this line in your .vimrc and changing the "<F11>" to your key of choice.

                                                *fugitive-:Git*
call f11#togglemap("<F11>")
